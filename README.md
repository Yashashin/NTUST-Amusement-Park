In this project, I developed a captivating amusement park using OpenGL.
Upon loading the model, I implemented facilities to operate by applying **Hierarchy Transformation Matrix**. Additionally, I wrote custom shaders to render water and facilities, ensuring a realistic and immersive experience for visitors.

_IDE: Visual Studio 2019_
