# Amusement-Park
電腦圖學導論Project 5

In this project, I built a wonderful amusement park with OpenGL. 
- After the model being loaded, I made facilities run by applying **Hierachy Transformation Matrix**.
- Wrote specific shaders to draw water and facilities.
- Used bezier curve and considered arc length to generate tracks for roller coaster.
